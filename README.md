# DeliveryManagementSystem
Simulation of a stock management and delivery routes optimization system for stock distribution and management in a manufacturing factory.
practice of: 
•recursive implementation of graphs to optimize driving routes (most packages delivered in shortest distance)
•decoding and validating 12 digit UPC barcode given in BMP format(https://www.wikihow.com/Read-12-Digit-UPC-Barcodes), (https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/upc.htm).
•learn Endianness (Windows platforms are considered little endian)
•calculate Gas in the truck's tank in respect to time. (used this equasion: 𝑓̇(𝑡) =𝑑𝑓/𝑑𝑡 = −∝∙ 𝑝(𝑡) ∙ 𝑓(𝑡) − 𝛽v, where: v=60, 𝛽=0.5, ∝=0.1 )
